# OnTop Wallet Management
This is a Wallet Management project built with Java 17 and Spring Boot 2.7.*. The goal of this application is to handle money transfers from OnTop accounts to recipient accounts while applying an OnTop fee. To implement all functionalities, I have used instances of Kafka and MongoDB through docker-compose.
